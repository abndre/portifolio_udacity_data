# Data Science

Hello, My name is Andre, 

I am currently studying to become a better data scientist. 
Here I put my analysis, to be able to share with the community.
 Welcome and any help is welcome.
 
 Below I have a link for you to explore each analysis individually.
 
 ## Stack Overflow Developer Survey
 In February 2020 nearly 65,000 developers told us how they learn 
 and level up, which tools theyâ€™re using, and what they want. 
 
In this analysis I try to find a relationship between work and happiness.
