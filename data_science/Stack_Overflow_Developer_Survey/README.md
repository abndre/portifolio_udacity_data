# Stack Overflow Data - 2017 Survey
You might have different questions about the 2017 StackOverflow survey data 
than I looked at earlier in the course. If you choose this dataset, you can 
not use the same questions that were analyzed earlier in the classroom.

Alternatively, if you felt pretty confident with the techniques in this lesson,
you might be looking to push the envelope. In this case, you may choose to 
retrieve all of the Stack Overflow Survey - Multiple Years results. 
From this data, you could analyze trends over time. 
What languages were most popular in each year? 
What other changes can you observe over time?
